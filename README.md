Email is a way to send and receive messages across the Internet. It's similar to traditional mail, but it also has some key differences. 
           Email is the modern way to send letters – you can send a message to the other side of the world and get a reply in minutes! Email is short for electronic mail. An email is a letter that is sent over a computer network instead of being sent through the post. Sending and receiving email is generally free, and you can actually send an email to as many people as you like. Each person on email has a unique email address, which is how you direct an email address to a specific person. You can even send emails to yourself. This sounds kind of silly, but people do this to send themselves reminders. All your emails come into your Inbox, which is like your virtual letter box. You can have multiple email addresses if you like. You don’t have to limit yourself to just one! An email address always has an @ symbol (pronounced at). If a person uses a free web mail service their address will have that service’s name after the @ symbol. 
For example:			myname@smail.com.
A quick walkthrough of how to send an email:
•	First, a new email is created
•	Then, recipient addresses are filled in
•	Next, a subject line is entered
•	Then the content of the email is typed in
And the email is sent.

This software encrypts the message on the sender's machine and then the recipient's machine uses the same encryption key to run a decryption procedure and make the email message readable. Encryption is a method to cypher data that a user sends and receives, as well as data that resides on endpoints and servers. To get a better idea of what email is all about, take a look at the infographic below and consider how you might benefit from its use.

Email advantages
